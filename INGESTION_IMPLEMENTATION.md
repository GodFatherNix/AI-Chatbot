            'INSAT-3D', 'OCEANSAT-2', 'SCATSAT-1', 'MEGHA-TROPIQUES'
        }
        self.instrument_patterns = {
            'Ocean Color Monitor', 'OCM', 'Ku-band Scatterometer', 'OSCAT'
        }
        # Add custom entity patterns to spaCy pipeline

class RelationshipExtractor:
    """Extract relationships between entities."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.relation_patterns = {
            'CARRIES': [r'(\w+)\s+carries?\s+(\w+)'],
            'MEASURES': [r'(\w+)\s+measures?\s+(\w+)'],
            'OPERATES_IN': [r'(\w+)\s+operates?\s+in\s+(\w+)']
        }
```

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Extracts 5 types of entities: MISSION, INSTRUMENT, PARAMETER, LOCATION, RESOLUTION
- ✅ Identifies 3 types of relationships: CARRIES, MEASURES, OPERATES_IN
- ✅ Uses both pattern-based and co-occurrence relationship extraction
- ✅ Stores in Neo4j with batch operations for efficiency
- ✅ Provides graph querying capabilities
